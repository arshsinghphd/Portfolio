PROJECT TITLE:<br>
Opioids And Non-Physicians' Prescriptive Powers

<details>
<summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
I am Arsh Singh, my PhD is in Applied Microeconomics, and I am interested in applied data science.
</details>

GOAL:<br>
In this project I am testing my hypothesis that laws allowing non-physicians like Physician's Assistant and Nurse Practitioners may have contributed to the opioid crisis. This refers to three kinds of increased freedoms for non-physicians:  Physician's Assistant (PA) can prescribe Schedule II drugs, Nurse Practitioners (NP) can Prescribe Schedule II drugs such as opioids, and NP no longer needs physician's (MD) oversight for prescriptions.

  <details>
  <summary>SOURCE</summary>
	I am using the ARCOS dataset cleaned and made available by WaPo. The dataset spans 2006-2012 and follows every pill prescribed. <a href="https://wpinvestigative.github.io/arcos/#download-the-raw-data">WaPo ARCOS Raw Data</a>.<br>
	For state populations I use data from the US Census. <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2000-2010/intercensal/county/co-est00int-tot.csv">2000-2010</a>, <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2020/state/totals/nst-est2020.csv">2010-2020.</a><br>
	Various law passage data are taken from <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4730953/>Gadbois et al. (2015)</a> Accessed on 12-24-2022.

  <summary>VARIABLES</summary>
  DRUG AMOUNTS: <br>
  In the analysis presented here I use Opioid drug amounts sold calculated as Dosage (Units) * Dosage (Strength) for each transaction, summed at the state-month level. I also standardize this by the population of the state to account for the size of the state. <br>
  TIME: <br>
  Time in this analysis is months since the law passed. This is different for the three different laws under consideration law and the states. This is the strength of regression discontinuity, it lines up time in different states around laws than linear time, making it possible to see how these laws affect the opioid prescription overall. This approach takes care of country-wide effects associated with particular years.
  LAW: <br>
  There are 3 kind of laws analyzed here: <br>
  NP = law that permits NPs to prescribe opioids <br>
  PA = law that permits PAs to prescribe opioids <br>
  NP_NO_MD = law that permits NPs to prescribe without MD oversight <br>
  I use a binary variable = 0 if the law doesn't permit non-physician to prescribe opioids, it becomes 1 after the law is passed in the state.

  <summary>Statistical Techniques/Skills</summary>
  Panel regressions with robust covariance  (fixed-effects and random-effects) that confirms a regression discontinuity.

  <summary>Main Results</summary>
  Since all these laws are passed around the same time, the visuals can be misleading, but I show one image that confirm RD. I mostly rely on panel regressions with robust covariance  (fixed effects and random effects) that confirms a regression discontinuity. <br>
  For the states and the time period I analyze, passage of these laws explain 17%+ of variation in the data. <br>
  When I analyze all the laws together, allowing NPs to prescribe seems to have the largest impact. Allowing PAs to prescribe and reducing MD supervision seem to increases opioid prescriptions at the beginning and are associated with a decrease per month. Allowing NPs to prescribe however, seems to reduce the prescription at the beginning and the is associated with large increasing trends.<br>
